# UIDesignHandOff
Designers and coder haven't always gotten along. Well my early introduction to sketch app for UI design has also got me familiar to a new tool called Zeplin. This tool claims to easy handoff between designers and codes. This is just an attempt to use Zeplin to try and replicate a SketchApp design in Xcode.

Lets make the problem statement clear. I am going to try to replicate the following design in xcode. In this process, I am going to slice important assets from the screen and export them via zeplin. 

For all the sketch masters out there who might say that one could export sliced assets directly from sketch. However, the primary reason zeplin is trying to be helpful is that alongwith exporting assets of the perfect size, it also enables the designer to export a styleguide code which can be very usefull for the developer.


The design I am working with is the following:
